          <p><em>The World Wide Web</em> is the name given to all of the
          computers able to communicate with each other via the world's
          largest network, called the Internet. When a person types in a
          <em>URL</em> like www.google.com into their <em>web browser
          </em>'s address bar their computer sends an <em>HTTP</em> 
          Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate <em>HTML
          </em> document and sends it back to the user's computer where 
          a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's 
          screen. This

          <strong>The World Wide Web</strong> - An information system of 
          interlinked HTML documents that are accessed via the Internet. 
          Individual document pages on the World Wide Web are called web 
          pages and are accessed with a software application running on 
          the user's computer, commonly called a web browser. Web pages 
          may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia 
          components, as well as web navigation features consisting of
          hyperlinks. It was invented in the early 1990's and today has 
          approximately 30 billion pages.

          <strong>HTTP</strong> - Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 
          HTTP is an application layer protocol for distributed, 
          collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the 
          foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
          Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links 
          (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the

          string that constitutes a reference to a resource, namely a web 
          page. Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the 
          page in an address bar.

          <header><h2>Tags and Elements</h2></header>
          <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, 
          we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
          HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting
          of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like &lt;html &gt;). HTML 
          tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt;and &lt;/h1 &gt;,
          although some tags represent <em>empty elements</em> and so are
          unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in a pair is 
          the <em>start tag</em>, and the second tag is the <em>end 
          tag</em> (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and 
          <em>closing tags</em>).

          <p>
          An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags
          that define the inline element. Generally, inline elements may
          contain only data and other inline elements. By default, Inline
          elements are normally displayed without line breaks.

          <header><h2>Block Elements</h2></header>
          <p>
          Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside 
          of them. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its 
          parent element (container), thereby creating a "block." Browsers 
          typically display the block-level element with a newline both 
          before and after the element. Block-level elements may appear 
          only within a &lt;body&gt; element. Generally, block-level 
          elements may contain inline elements and other block-level 
          elements. Inherent in this structural distinction is the idea 
          that block elements create "larger" structures than inline 
          elements. The distinction of block-level vs. inline elements is
          used in HTML specifications up  to 4.01. In HTML5, this binary
          distinction is replaced with a more complex set of content 
          categories. The "block-level" category roughly corresponds to
          the category of flow content in HTML5, while "inline" 
          corresponds to phrasing content, but there are additional
          categories.

          HTML and CSS are both languages. HTML controls the 
          "structure" of a web page while CSS controls the "style" of a 
          page (how it looks).

          <header><h2>Tree Structure of HTML</h2></header>
          <p>The tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical
          nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree 
          structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, 
          even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an 
          actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.
          </p>
          <p>
          In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type 
          (ADT) or data structure implementing this ADT that simulates a 
          hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of 
          children, represented as a set of linked nodes. 
          </p>
          <p>
          A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a
          collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is
          a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of 
          references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no
          reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
          </p>
          <p>
          Alternatively, a tree can be defined abstractly as a whole 
          (globally) as an ordered tree, with a value assigned to each
          node.
          </p>
          <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements
          can have other elements inside of them. In a browser, this 
          structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes
          inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

          <p>
          When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing
          indentations going up and down the left side of the document. 
          The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's 
          corresponding "box" is.

          When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like 
          Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
          life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
          generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

          interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. 
          The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure,
          called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed
          and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public

          particular browser, such as Internet Explorer. Others, such as
          Blink, WebKit, and Gecko, are shared by a number of browsers, 
          such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. The different
          layout engines implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of
          compliance.

          <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used 
          describing the look and formatting of a document written in a 
          markup language. While most often used to change the style of
          web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the
          language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including
          plain XML, SVG and XUL. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology
          used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user
          interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many 
          mobile applications.
          </p>
          <p>
          CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document 
          content from document presentation, including elements such as 
          the layout, colors, and fonts. 
          </p>
          <p>
          This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
          flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
          characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting
          by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
          complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as 
          semantically insignificant tables that were widely used to format
          pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major
          browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
          CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the 
          HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. 
          For each matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting 
          instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
          This separation of formatting and content makes it possible to 
          present the same markup page in different styles for different 
          rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when 
          read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and on 
          Braille-based, tactile devices. 
          </p>
          <p>
          It can also be used to display the web page differently depending
          on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed.
          <p>
          The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine 
          which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a 
          particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities or 
          weights are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results
          are predictable.

          <header><h2>CSS Specificity</h2></header>
          <p>
          <em>Specificity</em> describes the relative weights of various rules. 
          It determines which styles are applied to an element when more than one
          rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g., H1) 
          has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID
          selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not
          carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate the 
          "digits"

          mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a 
          specified element, but also to its descendants.[11] Inheritance
          relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of (X)HTML 
          elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may 
          inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing 
          them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related 
          properties, but box-related properties are not inherited. 
          Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing,
          line-height, list-style, text-align text-indent, text-transform,
          visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot
          be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, 
          height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline,
          overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and
          z-index.
          </p>
          <p>
          Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over
          and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers
          to write less CSS. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by 
          users and enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and 
          development costs.

          <p>
          <strong>Inline Styling</strong> - To use inline styles, add the 
          style attribute to the relevant tag. An inline style loses many
          of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with 
          presentation). Use this method sparingly! The style attribute
          can contain any CSS property. The example shows how to change 
          the color and the left margin of a h1 element:
          <p>
          &lt;h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;"&gt;This is a heading.&lt;/h1&gt;
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Internal Style Sheet</strong> - An internal style sheet 
          should be used when a single document has a unique style. You 
          define internal styles in the head section of an HTML page, 
          inside the &lt;style&gt; tag, like this:
          </p>
          <p>
          &lt;head&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;style&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;body {<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;background-color: linen; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; h1 { <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;color: maroon; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;margin-left: 40px; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/style&gt; <br>
          &lt;head&gt;
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>External Style Sheets</strong> - An external style sheet
          is ideal when the style is applied to many pages. With an 
          external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire Web
          site by changing just one file.
          </p>
          <p>
          Each page must include a link to the style sheet with the 
          &lt;link&gt; tag. The &lt;link&gt; tag goes inside the head section:
          </p>
          <p>
          &lt;head&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;link rel="stylesheet" 
          type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt;<br>
          &lt;/head&gt;

          <header><h2>Box Sizing</h2></header>        
          <p>
          The four main points to remember about box-sizing:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components</li>
            <li>Because there are so many components to each box, it 
            can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
            </li>
            <li>There are two techniques you can use to help deal with
            sizing issues.</li>
              <ol class="b">
                <li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.</li>
                <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for 
                every element
                </li>
              </ol>
            <li>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes
            this causes different browsers to display the same code 
            differently.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <header><h2>Box Positioning</h2></header>
          <ol>
            <li>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by 
            default they take up the entire width of a page.
            </li>
            <li>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS
            will override this behavior and let divs appear next to 
            each other.

          Get the structure of the page right. You should be able to do 
          that from the design by visually boxifying it, then move on to
          work on the tags, i.e., if something needs to be a heading, 
          make it so. Then think about the size of the boxes (how big 
          should they be) and then think about positioning the boxes so 
          that they are where you want them on the screen.  Once the general
          layout is complete, then begin looking at the smaller details.
          </p>
          <p>
          Steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
            <li>Look for repeated styles & semantic elements</li>
            <li>Write your html</li>
            <li>Apply your styles from biggest to smallest.</li>
            <li>Fix things</li>
