What I learned about making an IOS application.

In order to learn more I took an additional class via Udacity.  I took the "Intro to iOS App Development with Swift".

In Lesson 1 I learned about XCode:

This lesson covered downloading and installing Xcode.

The To Do List.  

The following is a breakdown of solution requirements:

1. Add buttons to the app
2. Add images to the buttons
3. add text to our app
4. Show and hide text
5. Save an audio file in Swift
6. Transitions between screens
7. Play audio
8. change audio speed in swift.


MVC is the acro for Model, View and Control.  Apple likes for devopers to use this construct to design apps.

We began using XCode and created the first version of the project application

Downloading XCode took me two days, which was Apples issue not my internet connection.  


In Lesson 2, we reviewed how to Add a Button.

we learned how to make buttons and labels.  How to align them and how to assign actions or outlets to them.

Actions and outlets are important in this context so I copied the definitions below.

Action - In this case the View sends a message to our ViewController. Much like when we write an action inside our ViewController to do something when the microphone button is pressed.

Outlet - In this case the ViewController has a variable that it will use when it talks to the View. Much like when our ViewController uses the variable recordingInProgress to show or hide the label on the View.


In Lesson 3, I learned how to play audio, change the speed and how to naviagate between screens.

In this lesson, I learned we improved the design of my app by hiding the stop button and disabling the microphone button when the user attempts to record their voice.

I also learned how to move from one screen of the app to another using the Navigation Control.  Also how to link buttons to a screen view.

we also explored how to set different screens with set parameters.   How to change the rate of play was easier than I thought.

In Lesson 4, I learned how to record an audio file.
